# Time Entry API

A small HTTP API for the time-tracking slice of an HRIS: employees log work
hours, managers approve or reject them, and a weekly summary rolls the totals up
for payroll.

See [api.md](api.md) for endpoint reference, request/response shapes, and
Postman setup.

## What I built, and what I deliberately didn't

**Built:** all four endpoints from the brief, backed by a (file) SQLite store
via Drizzle, with input validation, a consistent JSON error envelope, and the
data-integrity checks that matter for payroll. I also implemented `reject` as
the natural pair to `approve`, the brief only called out approve, but a manager
needs to be able to dispute an entry too, and the action enum makes the endpoint
shape clean. The hours/overlap/week math is factored into pure functions so the
rules are readable and unit-testable in isolation.

**Didn't build, on purpose:** auth, pagination, editing or deleting entries,
multi-tenancy, and automated tests (see the tests note below). No frontend or
OpenAPI docs, the brief explicitly de-prioritized those.

## Ambiguities I found, and how I resolved them

I resolved these by making and documenting assumptions rather than asking, since
the brief invited that and none of them are one-way doors:

1. **`date` + `start_time` + `end_time` vs. full instants.** The brief modeled
   an entry as a calendar date plus two wall-clock times. That can't represent a
   shift that crosses midnight without ambiguity. I store two full ISO instants
   instead — midnight-spanning is then just an entry whose start and end fall on
   different days, with zero special-casing.

2. **Route shape.** The brief shows flat routes (`POST /time-entries`,
   `POST /time-entries/{id}/approve`). I nested everything under
   `/employees/:employeeId/` so the resource ownership is explicit in the URL
   and the employee can be validated at the routing layer. This is a deliberate
   deviation from the spec shape.

3. **Employee/manager identity.** I kept them as separate tables with integer
   ids rather than the `emp_123`/`mgr_456` strings. A side effect:
   **self-approval is structurally impossible** — an approver id points at the
   managers table, an entry's owner at the employees table, so there is no
   shared id space to collide on.

4. **"Week" semantics.** `week=2026-06-01` is treated as the first day of a
   7-day window `[week, week+7)`. I do not snap it to a Monday — the caller
   decides where the week starts. Entries are bucketed by their `startTime`.

5. **Timezone.** All boundary math uses `setUTCHours`/`setUTCDate` so a weekly
   window or list range doesn't shift depending on what timezone the server runs
   in.

## Edge cases handled

- **End before or equal to start** → `400`. Zero or negative duration is never
  valid work.
- **Entry longer than 24h** → `400`. A >1-day entry is almost always a typo
  (wrong AM/PM, forgotten clock-out) and shouldn't reach a paycheck. The cap is
  a named constant in one place.
- **Overlapping entries** for the same employee → `409`. You can't be in two
  places at once. Overlap uses half-open intervals, so `09–17` and `17–18` are
  adjacent, not a conflict. Rejected entries are excluded from the check, so a
  corrected re-submission is allowed. The check is pushed to the DB
  (`startTime < candidateEnd AND endTime > candidateStart`) so we never load
  unbounded history into memory.
- **Approving or flipping an already-decided entry** → `409`. Re-approving or
  rejecting a decided entry would silently rewrite payroll history; only
  `pending` entries can be acted on.
- **Unknown employee, manager, or entry** → `404` on every route, including the
  case where an entry id doesn't belong to the employee in the URL path.
- **Self-approval** → impossible by construction.
- **Malformed or invalid input** → `400` with a structured `{ error, issues }`
  array identifying the offending fields, not a raw Zod blob.

## Edge cases I consciously skipped

- **Concurrency / double-submit.** Two simultaneous creates could both pass the
  overlap check and both insert (TOCTOU race); two approvals could race on the
  status check. The bulletproof fix is a transaction wrapping the
  check-then-write with a DB-level exclusion constraint as the real backstop.
  Out of scope for this slice, but it is the first thing I would close before
  this touched real money.
- **Future-dated entries** are allowed. Logging planned time is plausible and
  the brief didn't say otherwise.
- **Entries spanning a week boundary** are counted whole in the week of their
  `startTime`, not split. Documented assumption.
- **Daylight-saving / per-employee timezones.** Everything is UTC; real payroll
  needs the employee's local timezone to define "a day" and "a week."
- **Pagination.** The list endpoint returns all matching entries. Fine for this
  store; would need a limit/offset or cursor for production.

## How I used LLM tools

I drove this with Claude Code throughout: it generated the schema, route
handlers, and pure helpers, and I steered the design decisions and reviewed
every diff.

**Accepted as-is:** The weekly summary aggregation, split by project, approved
vs. pending, with a re-rounding pass on accumulated totals to prevent
floating-point drift. The logic was correct and matched how I'd write it, so it
stood.

**Pushed back / rewrote — two examples:**

1. _UTC boundary bug._ The first cut of the weekly window used local-time
   `setHours(0,0,0,0)` on a date parsed as UTC. A manual test surfaced it
   immediately — `week=2026-06-01` came back as `weekStart: 2026-05-31`, an
   off-by-one driven purely by the server's timezone. For payroll that's the
   worst kind of bug (silently moves hours between weeks), so I rewrote all
   boundary math onto `setUTCHours`/`setUTCDate`.

2. _Validation error format._ The default `@hono/zod-validator` error response
   was a stringified `ZodError` blob — `message` was a JSON string inside a JSON
   string, completely unusable for a client trying to show field-level errors. I
   asked for a structured `{ error, issues }` envelope where each issue surfaces
   its `path` and `message` cleanly. The implementation required knowing that
   Zod v4 uses `PropertyKey[]` (not `string[]`) for issue paths, which the first
   type-safe attempt got wrong — caught by `tsc`.

## Tradeoffs I'd revisit for production

- **No transactions around check-then-write.** The overlap and status checks are
  read-then-write and not atomic. Production needs them inside a transaction
  with a uniqueness/exclusion constraint as the real backstop.
- **24h cap and overlap rules are hard-coded.** In reality these are
  org/jurisdiction config, not constants in a helper file.
- **No audit trail beyond `reviewedAt` and `approverId`.** Payroll disputes want
  a full history of who changed what and when.
- **No pagination.** The list endpoint will return every matching entry forever.
  Needs a limit before the table gets large.

## How I decided it was done

All four endpoints work against a real store, and every edge case the brief
called out, midnight spans, overlaps, end-before-start, re-approval,
self-approval, has an explicit, tested behavior with the right status code and a
clean error response. `tsc` passes clean. I ran the Postman collection
end-to-end (happy path and every error branch).

## What would scare a teammate most

The **check-then-write race**. The overlap and "still pending?" guards are
correct under sequential calls but not atomic, so under real concurrency two
requests can both pass the check and write. It's the gap between "looks correct
in a demo" and "correct under load," and it's invisible until two requests land
in the same millisecond — exactly the kind of thing that corrupts payroll
quietly. The fix is known (transaction + DB constraint); I left it out to keep
the slice small, but it's the first thing I'd close before this touched real
money.

## A note on tests

I skipped an automated test suite to stay inside the spirit of the slice, but
the code is shaped for it: all the business rules, duration calculation, overlap
detection, week windowing, summary aggregation, are pure functions with no side
effects and would be quick to cover with a unit test file.
